I am dedicating my life to making biology easier to engineer.

I both want to understand how the world works at its core and build huge systems
that change how we interact (or think) about living things.

A lot of progress has been stalled because people aren't ambitious
enough or diversely technical. [Social cancer](https://www.facebook.com/) and
[(misaligned) incentives](https://www.janestreet.com/) certainly don't help.

There's a very real and unique opportunity to rewrite history over the next few
decades. Computing (the serverless kind), statistics (the ml kind), and
automation (the non-grad student kind) are doing something special in a field
that has been more qualitative then quantitative since its birth. 

If you're good with computers and have high risk tolerance (or stronger
curiousity, take your pick), you should probably think about hopping on board.
