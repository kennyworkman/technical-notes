why relevant:

  * powerful class of transforms with nice properties (continuous) for learning
  * represented as differential manifolds, which also interested in


Also working on biologically-inspired vision systems mentored by [Bruno
Olshausen](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/baolshausen.html).
Lie groups + sparse codes have great emperical results
